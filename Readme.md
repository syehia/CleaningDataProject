# Assumptions
* Inertial Signals files are not used or read in this exercise since they are not needed
* the only features extracted are those wich has "mean()" or "std()" in their fetaure name (see features.txt). "MeanFreq()" measurement **is not** included becuase this is a weighted avergae of frequncy doamin (and not mean of measurements)
* I am also excluding the "angle" features (last 7 features in features.txt")
* I followed the order given by the assignement
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
