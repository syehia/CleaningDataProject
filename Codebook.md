## Study description and design
The study is based on the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set in UCOI Machine Learrning Repository [1]. Detailed data set are found in 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The original data set contains two separate data set, train and test. Please refer to "README.txt", "features.txt" and "features_info.txt" of the orginal data set for a thorough description of the data set.

The current study does the following

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. The data set also aggregates subject ID (in ```subject_(train|test).txt)``` and activity ID (in ```y_(train|test).txt)``` with the main data (```X_(train|test).txt```) in one table
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. specifically, we characterized those as the features in the original data which names contain either ```mean()``` or ```std()```, that results in 66 features extracted from the original data set (in addition to the subject ID and Activity).
3. replace activity number by their descriptive activity names (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
4. Appropriatly label the column name: removing special characters, enhancing readability, and removing anomalies 
5. creates a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This is the final output of the study. The variables of the final output are detailed in the codebook section.

All transformation are done using the script run_alaysis.R in the submited repo. See Readme.md for instructions on reproduccing the data set.
